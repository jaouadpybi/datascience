The variance of each component can be visualized in graph as scree plot. The Scree plot helps on identiying the the most important princpial components. We can visualize the reduced data to get better understanding of the data. We can also use the reduced data in machine learning. In fact, reduced data helps training machine learning a great deal.

This means Princpal component analysis helps on reducing the dimentionalty, and the variance of each PC can be used to determine the importance of the PC. The greater the variance the important the PC is. In the other hand the lower the variance the less important the PC in expalaining the data. Therefore, PCs with lower variance can be ignored in the analysis."
